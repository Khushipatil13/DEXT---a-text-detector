# DEXT---a-text-detector
this is an android application that detects the text from the image
i have used MACHINE LEARNING KIT to
recognize text in images.The general-purpose API has both on-device and cloudbased models. We have done this in ANDROID STUDIO using JAVA and XML in
backend and front-end respectively
